## Locked decisions (from ADR 0001)

- Monorepo · Google Maps Platform · raw SQL + Alembic · Supabase Storage.
- **Shared FastAPI backend (logical).** Physically **co-located** inside the
  intake app for now; **extraction to a standalone `apps/api` / `cluexp-api`
  project is deferred** until a second frontend (technician/dispatcher) lands.

## 🔑 Needs from you (blockers, do in parallel)

- [x] **Google Maps — two keys** (both keys were provided in chat; restrict them
  in Google Cloud and do not commit them. Add them to Vercel env vars only.
  Server-side calls and browser rendering must use different,
  separately-restricted keys):
  - `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` (server credential; second key provided): enable Geocoding + Routes; restrict by **API +
    IP/secret** usage. Never shipped to the browser.
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPS_BROWSER_KEY` (browser map render; first key provided): **Maps JS only**, restricted by
    **HTTP referrer (domain)**.
- [ ] ⚠️ **FIX `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` restriction (do later, remind me).**
  Live verification of `GET /api/geocode` (2026-06-01) returned
  `REQUEST_DENIED — "API keys with referer restrictions cannot be used with this
  API."` The server key currently carries an **HTTP-referrer restriction**, which
  Google rejects for the server-side Geocoding API. The endpoint, helper, and key
  injection all work — only the key restriction is wrong. Fix in **Google Cloud
  Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → (the GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY key):**
  - **Application restrictions → None** (Vercel egress IPs are dynamic, so no IP
    restriction; the referrer restriction belongs only on the *browser* key).
  - **API restrictions → restrict to Geocoding API** (add Routes API later).
  - Leave `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPS_BROWSER_KEY` as-is (HTTP-referrer + Maps JS only).
  - No redeploy needed; Google applies it in ~1–2 min. Then re-hit
    `GET /api/geocode?q=<address>` to confirm coordinates come back.
- [x] **Supabase Storage:** buckets created in Supabase dashboard:
  `public-tech-media` + `private-verification`.
- [ ] **Rotate** the Vercel token + Supabase DB password when we wrap (both shared in chat).

---

## Sprint 0 — Foundation

**Goal:** make the *live* app safe, then lay clean structure + the data layer.
Tasks are in execution order; live-hardening runs **before** the restructure.

- [x] **Database** — Alembic baseline (`0001`); 6 baseline dispatch tables applied to Supabase.
- [x] **Live hardening (do first — the app is already public)** ⚠️
  - [x] Lock down `POST /tickets` / `PATCH /tickets/{id}` so clients set only
        user-editable intake fields; reject `trust_state`, `technician_assignment`,
        `final_charge`, and payment fields from the browser.
  - [x] Env-driven **CORS**; restrict production origins (no `*`).
  - [x] Frontend **`ticket_id` rehydration** (persist + restore; no duplicate
        tickets on refresh/back).
  - [x] **Demo/production flag** so fulfillment/payment-review screens cannot be
        mistaken for real operations.
  - [x] Real handoff **"Call now"** action (tel: / dispatcher callback), not a dead button.
- [x] **CI** — add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (typecheck, build, py compile,
      schema→types drift check, Alembic offline render). See `DEVOPS.md §3`.
- [x] ⚠️ **Monorepo restructure** — *API stays co-located in the intake app*
      (single Vercel project); only folders move:
  - `src/`, `next.config.mjs`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next-env.d.ts`, `vercel.json` → `apps/intake-web/`
  - `api/`, `requirements.txt` → **`apps/intake-web/api/`** (co-located)
  - `assets/schema.py` → `apps/intake-web/api/schema.py`
  - `scripts/generate_types.py` → `apps/intake-web/scripts/generate_types.py`
  - generated `schema.generated.ts` → `apps/intake-web/src/types/`
  - `assets/ui/` → `docs/design-ref/` (visual reference only)
  - Update imports (`from assets.schema` → `from api.schema`), the
    type-gen path, and `vercel.json` function globs.
  - [x] ⚠️ Update the Vercel project **Root Directory** to `apps/intake-web`;
        re-verify build; **redeploy**; smoke-test the live flow.
  - *(Deferred: standalone `packages/schema` and `apps/api` / `cluexp-api` —
    do this when `technician-web` arrives.)*
- [~] **Supabase Storage** — buckets exist; operationalize them:
  - [x] `public-tech-media` (public, CDN) · `private-verification` (private).
  - **RLS policies:** owner-scoped read/write on `private-verification`; deny by
    default; public read only on `public-tech-media`.
  - **Signed-URL rules:** upload TTL ~60s, download TTL ~300s.
  - **Limits:** max 10 MB; MIME allowlist (`image/*`; `application/pdf` for IDs);
    **validate size + MIME server-side before issuing the signed URL**.
- [~] **Google Maps** — keys are stored; add a backend `geocode(address)`
      helper (server key); confirm a test address resolves.

**Acceptance:** live app has payload lockdown + restricted CORS + a demo flag;
repo is `apps/`+`packages/` with intake still green in prod; CI runs on PRs;
buckets exist **with policies + size/MIME limits**; `geocode()` returns coords.

---

## Sprint 1 — Intake on the real model

**Goal:** intake stops using the single `tickets` blob and writes the relational model.

- [x] **Store layer** — replace the `tickets` JSONB store with `jobs` + `customers`:
  - `POST /tickets`: upsert `customers` (by phone when known) + insert `jobs`;
    `jobs.detail` holds the Ticket payload; promote `trust_state`, `status`,
    `access_type`, `situation`, `lat`, `lng`, `address`, `customer_id`.
  - `require_ticket`/`save` read/write `jobs`; `events` rows carry `job_id`.
  - Keep the API response contract (envelope + guards) unchanged.
- [ ] **Real geocoding** — GPS/address persists `lat`/`lng` + `geocode_confidence`.
- [ ] **Photo upload to Storage** — `POST /tickets/{id}/photo-intent` → signed URL;
      browser uploads direct to `private-verification` (size/MIME enforced);
      record a `media` row; the intake Photos screen actually stores.
- [ ] **Migration** `0002_*` if columns need adjusting.

**Acceptance:** a full run creates `customers`+`jobs`+`media` rows; coords stored;
photo lands in the private bucket and is **only** reachable via a signed URL (RLS verified).

---

## Sprint 2 — Provider registry + matching v1

- [x] **Provider tenant schema** — support individual technicians and
      company/group organizations with affiliated technicians
      (`organizations`, recursive `organization_teams`,
      `organization_technicians`, `organization_team_technicians`, technician
      `provider_type`, `provider_documents`).
- [ ] Organization onboarding: company/group can register itself, set service
      area/contact details, add description/notes, create
      departments/groups/business units, and invite or bulk-create affiliated
      technicians.
- [ ] Team management: teams can be nested, described, activated/deactivated,
      and assigned one or many affiliated technicians.
- [ ] Compliance documents: upload/review/expire documents for organizations
      and technicians only; teams are virtual and have no legal docs.
- [ ] Individual technician onboarding remains supported for solo operators.
- [ ] Seed `organizations` + teams + `technicians` (individual + affiliated;
      varied skills/areas) + a minimal admin list view.
- [ ] **Dispatch engine v1** (deterministic, outside the intake graph per SPEC §2.7):
      score by distance (service_area), skill (`access_type`/key type), availability, rating.
- [ ] `/dispatch` creates `dispatch_offers` for top-N; first accept wins; timeout →
      next; assigns `jobs.technician_id`; when affiliated, also records
      `jobs.provider_organization_id`; flips `trust_state=matched`.
- [ ] Technician location ping (`current_lat/lng`).

**Acceptance:** dispatch picks a real seeded technician by rule, whether solo or
affiliated; offers record the technician and provider organization where
applicable; trust gating intact.

---

## Sprint 3 — Fulfillment maps

- [ ] Real Google map on tracking screen (browser key).
- [ ] Backend traffic-aware ETA via Routes API (replaces the `sin()` stub).
- [ ] Live position polling from `technicians.current_lat/lng`.
- [ ] Mutual arrival handshake (tech proves to customer) backed by a real code store.

**Acceptance:** customer sees a real map + backend ETA; arrival verified both ways.

---

## Sprint 4 — Payments + OTP (restore deferred)

- [ ] Stripe: auth-hold at `commit`, capture at `finalize`, release on cancel;
      over-estimate approval before capture (make `finalize` able to exceed — fixes the dead path).
- [ ] Restore the payment-method precondition in `commit` + `is_dispatchable()`.
- [ ] Restore OTP send/verify in the flow.
- [ ] Idempotency keys on `commit`/`dispatch`/`charge`.

**Acceptance:** real auth-hold → capture; over-estimate path reachable; OTP gates; retries safe.

---

## Sprint 5 — Dispatcher console

- [ ] `dispatcher-web` app: live job queue, handoff inbox, overrides, safety escalation.

**Acceptance:** a human can take over any job from a console.

---

## Cross-cutting (ongoing — not deferred-and-forgotten)

> Live-app safety items moved into **Sprint 0** above. What remains is genuinely
> later/continuous:

- [ ] PII retention policy (purge `id_document` media N days post-completion; log to `events`).
- [ ] Audit-log retention/archival for `events`.
- [ ] Licensing/insurance checks per jurisdiction before activating an individual
      technician or a provider organization.
- [ ] Expiration monitoring for provider documents; prevent dispatch when
      required organization/technician documents are missing, rejected, or expired.
- [ ] Subscription/billing model for provider organizations.
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry) + API health check + alerting (see `DEVOPS.md §7`).
